# Project Overview 
-------------------
WSUV Twitter

For this project, I create a client iOS application for a Twitter-like service. User information and messages are stored on a server and are accessible via a web-based API using HTTP GET/POST methods.
I useD the delightful Alamofire framework to communicate with the server. Theapplication will allowthe user to. . .
- fetch and view the latest \tweets",
- authenticate (register, log-on, and log-out),
- post messages (authenticated users only), and
- delete messages that the user posted (bonus feature).

The tweets are stored remotely on the server, but are cached in a local array.
